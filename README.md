# OpenDataPortal

This is an approach that I worked on for a potential customer that allows for Qlik App's to be surfaced as Datasets, for the express purpose of identifying and extracting relevant information easily.

This solution uses a combination of the Capabilities API and the Engine API (via qSocks) to be able to easily provide the end user with a logical workflow for data extraction.
